                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Dylan and I'm an aspiring programmer.
                    <br />
                    I'm a beginner at coding as I only began in early 2020. I have some knowledge in python and some in HTML.
                    I am also learning how to make video games with Godot. I plan on developing an full game some time but at
                    the moment I still need to learn more about the program.

                    I have an Arduino Uno (although I rarely use it), a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 2GB ram running Raspberry
                    Pi OS and Manjaro XFCE, a Lenovo ideapad C340 running windows 10 with a SD card to run Manjaro XFCE.

                <p>
                    Projects I am currently working on include this website, a RFID door lock with an Arduino and a boot menu for
                    a Raspberry Pi Sense Hat. I
