        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Dylan and I'm an Australian programmer.
            I'm a beginner at coding as I only began in early 2020. I have some knowledge in python and some in HTML.
            I am also learning how to make video games with Godot. I plan on developing an full game some time but at
            the moment I still need to learn more about the program.
        </p>

            , a Lenovo ideapad C340 running windows 10 with a SD card to run Manjaro XFCE.
