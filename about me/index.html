                Hello, my name is Dylan and I'm an Australian programmer.
                I'm a beginner at coding as I only began in early 2020. I have some knowledge in python and some in HTML.
                I am also learning how to make video games with Godot. I plan on developing an full game some time but at
                the moment I still need to learn more about the program.
            </p>

                I have an Arduino Uno (although I rarely use it), a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 2GB ram running Raspberry Pi OS and Manjaro XFCE
                , a Lenovo ideapad C340 running windows 10 with a SD card to run Manjaro XFCE.
